## Malware scanner for secure upload of Blobs to Azure Storage

### Problem statement
Users can upload files to Azure blob storage for others to download.

We don't want the files downloaded to contain Malware.

### Solution
![Diagram of storage, web app, vm](img/blob-upload-malware2.png)
1. User uploads a file to a web app
1. Web app stores upload in container (named **quarantine**)
1. Web app adds message to queue to request scan in [Azure Storage Queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues?tabs=dotnet)
1. VM reads message and download file
1. VM scans for malware
1. A malware check is completed and either
  - If malware is found the file is moved to a container (named **malwarefound**) and deletes from quarantine
  - If file scan is OK then the file is moved to a container (named **scannedok**) and deletes from quarantine
1. Users of the application request download to web app
1. web app returns file from **ScannedOK** container

> Note: VM uses Managed Identity and KeyVault Policy to connect to KeyVault and request queue connection string and SAS tokens enabling read/write from containers
